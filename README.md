# Smart-irrigation-system

Agriculture is vital to our survival as people. Agricultural work is needed in almost every
aspect. Agriculture produces the majority of the world's fabrics, in addition to our daily food.
Agricultural items include cotton, wool, and leather. Agriculture also produces timber for
construction and paper products, and the list of benefits goes on. It is extremely important
throughout a country's entire life. Agriculture's success is determined by several conditions,
including enough irrigation, sunlight, and soil. Irrigation is a method of supplying controlled
amounts of water to plants using artificial means such as pipelines, ditches, and sprinklers. This
project would be extremely beneficial to farmers and nursery professionals since it would eliminate
the need for traditional or manual work
